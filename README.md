# Demonstration

Actions in this repository demonstrate what this GitHub Action is doing.

A successful run will look like

![Pass](docs/pass.png?raw=true)

A failed run will look like

![Fail](docs/fail.png?raw=true)

Then you can click on the filename line (`Check failure ... DummyTest.java` here), and you'll be
redirected to the test file with the annotation like
